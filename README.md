# Matrix-Multiplication-Python

In this method, we have to iterate through each row and each column items thatâ€™s why we use nested loops here.

Sample Output

Enter order of 1st matrix:

2 2

Enter Row wise values

Enter row 0 value:

1 2

Enter row 1 value:

2 3

Enter order of 2nd matrix:

2 2

Enter Row wise values

Enter row 0 value:

1 2

Enter row 1 value:

2 3

Matrix 1: [[1, 2], [2, 3]]

Matrix 2: [[1, 2], [2, 3]]

Matrix Multiplication: 

[5, 8]
[8, 13]
